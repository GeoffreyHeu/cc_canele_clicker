# CC Canalé Clicker.

If you don't know what a canelé is: it's a cupcake
Bordeaux, soft and tender, flavored with rum and vanilla (therefore
reserved for adults).

It has a fluted shape from which it takes its name
and that makes it easily recognizable.

The idle game or the clicker game
in English) is a genre of video games where interactivity is deliberately limited.

The "player" then not having much to do. This is typically the game we
let it run in the background while you do something else.
This genre, which appeared in the early 2000s,
popularized with the success of Cookie Clicker in 2013.

In this project we will mix the concept of
clicker game and canelés to create the Canelé game
Clicker.
